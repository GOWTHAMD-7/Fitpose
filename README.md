This is our final year project, and it includes all the trending technologies like AI and Deep Learning.
For 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-year students, this can be a great reference model to showcase in your college and score full marks.

## 📄 Research Paper

We have also published a research paper based on an earlier version of this project — feel free to check it out for reference.  
Since then, we've made significant improvements to the model.

 **[View Research Paper (PDF)](Paper/Paper%20published%20for%20reference.pdf)**


## Migration from Old Structure

If you're updating from the previous project structure, you can use the migration script to help organize your files:

```bash
python migrate_files.py
```

This script will copy files from the old structure to the new one while preserving the original files.

⚠️ Note: I won't be uploading the main folder and SQL file required to run the full model here.
📩 If you're interested in running the complete project, feel free to contact me — I'll provide all the necessary files and step-by-step guidance.
