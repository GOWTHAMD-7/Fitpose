This is our final year project, and it includes all the trending technologies like AI and Deep Learning. For 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-year students,
this can be a great reference model to showcase in your college and score full marks.

We have also published a research paper based on the earlier version of this project — feel free to check it out for reference.
Since then, we've made significant improvements to the model.

Note: I won't be uploading the main folder required to run the full model here.
If you’re interested in running the complete project, feel free to contact me
I’ll provide all the necessary files and step-by-step guidance.
